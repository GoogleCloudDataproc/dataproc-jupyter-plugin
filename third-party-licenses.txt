## Overview

This package introduces a number of concepts, such as session context, etc.
Here we give a brief overview of some of the top-level concepts in this
package.

### Clients

A _client_ is a single entity connected to a kernel. Since kernel messages
include the client id, it is easy for a client to filter kernel messages for
just messages between it and the kernel. In JupyterLab, different activities
(such as a console and a notebook) are usually considered separate clients when
connected to the same kernel.

### Kernel specs

A _kernel spec_ is the data about an available kernel on the system. We can
retrieve a current list of kernel specs from the server.

### Kernels

A _kernel_ represents a running process on the server that implements the
Jupyter kernel messaging protocol.

#### Kernel model

A _kernel model_ mirrors the server kernel models, and represents a single
running kernel on the server. A kernel can be created, restarted, shut down,
etc., through calls to the server. A kernel model's lifecycle mirrors the
server kernel model's lifecycle, and it will be disposed when the server
kernel is shut down.

#### Kernel connection

A _kernel connection_ represents a single client connecting to a kernel over a
websocket. Typically only one kernel connection handles comms for any given
kernel. The kernel connection is disposed when the client no longer has a need
for the connection. Disposing a kernel connection does not cause the kernel to
shut down. However, if a kernel is shut down, (eventually) all of its kernel
connections should be disposed if they were initiated from a kernel manager.
If the kernel connections were instantiated outside of a manager, you are
responsible for cleaning them up.

A kernel connection has a number of signals, such as kernel status, kernel
connection status, etc.

#### Kernel manager

A _kernel manager_ is an object that maintains a list of kernel models by
regular polling. The kernel manager can instantiate a kernel connection and
will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the kernel is shut down, the connections
will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around
kernels and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with
kernels on a server through a manager.

### Sessions

A _session_ is a mapping on the server from an identifying string (the
session's `path`) to a kernel. A session has a few other pieces of information
to allow for easy categorization and searching of sessions.

The primary usecase of a session is to enable persisting a connection to a
kernel. For example, a notebook viewer may start a session with session path
of the notebook's file path. When a browser is refreshed, the notebook viewer
can connect to the same kernel by asking the server for the session
corresponding with the notebook file path.

#### Session model

A _session model_ mirrors a server session. The session models can be
refreshed from the server, created, changed (including creating a new session
kernel), and shut down (which implies that the kernel will be shut down). A
session model's lifecycle mirrors the server session's lifecycle, and it will
be disposed when the server session is shut down.

#### Session connection

A _session connection_ represents a single client connected to a session's
kernel. A session's kernel connection can change and may be null to signify no
current kernel connection. A session connection owns the kernel connection,
meaning the kernel connection is created and disposed by the session
connection as needed. The session connection proxies signals from the kernel
connection for convenience (e.g., you can listen to the session's status
signal to get status changes for whatever the current kernel is, without
having to disconnect and reconnect your signal handlers every time the session
kernel changes). The session connection can be disposed when the client no
longer is connected to that session's kernel, and disposal will not cause the
session model to be deleted.

#### Session manager

A _session manager_ is an object that maintains a list of session models by
regular polling. The session manager can instantiate a session connection and
will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the session is shut down, the connections
will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around
sessions and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with
sessions on a server through a manager.

### Session Context

A _session context_ is an object which has the same lifecycle as the client.
The session context owns a session connection (which may be null if the client
is not currently associated with a session). The session context proxies the
current session connection's signals for convenience. The session context
primarily serves as a stable object for a client to keep track of the current
session connection. The session context also contains some convenience
functionality, such as preferences for whether a kernel should be started and
a user-friendly kernel name and status.

# @jupyterlab/ui-components

The
[@jupyterlab/ui-components](https://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/modules/_ui_components_src_index_.html)
package provides UI elements that are widely used in JupyterLab core,
and that can be reused in your own extensions.

For example, all of the icons in JupyterLab core can be reused via
`LabIcon`. You can also use `LabIcon` to create your own custom icons
that will be able to automatically change color to match the current
JupyterLab theme.

# `LabIcon` - set up and render icons

`LabIcon` is the icon class used by JupyterLab, and is part of the new
icon system introduced in JupyterLab v2.0.

## How JupyterLab handles icons

The @jupyterlab/ui-components package provides icons to the rest of
JupyterLab, in the form of a set of `LabIcon` instances (currently about
80). All of the icons in the core JupyterLab packages are rendered using
one of these `LabIcon` instances.

## Using the icons in your own code

You can use any of JupyterLab icons in your own code via an `import`
statement. For example, to use `jupyterIcon` you would first do:

```typescript
import { jupyterIcon } from '@jupyterlab/ui-components';
```

## How to render an icon into a DOM node

Icons can be added as children to any `div` or `span` nodes using the
`icon.element(...)` method (where `icon` is any instance of `LabIcon`).
For example, to render the Jupyter icon you could do:

```typescript
jupyterIcon.element({
  container: elem,
  height: '16px',
  width: '16px',
  marginLeft: '2px'
});
```

where `elem` is any `HTMLElement` with a `div` or `span` tag. As shown
in the above example, the icon can be styled by passing CSS parameters
into `.element(...)`. Any valid CSS parameter can be used (one catch:
snake case params do have to be converted to camel case: instead of
`foo-bar: '8px'`, you’d need to use `fooBar: '8px'`.

## How to render an icon as a React component

Icons can also be rendered using React. The `icon.react` parameter holds
a standard React component that will display the icon on render. Like
any React component, `icon.react` can be used in various ways.

For example, here is how you would add the Jupyter icon to the render
tree of another React component:

```jsx
public render() {
  return (
    <div className="outer">
      <div className="inner">
        <jupyterIcon.react tag="span" right="7px" top="5px" />
        "and here's a text node"
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you can just render the icon directly into any existing
DOM node `elem` by using the `ReactDOM` module:

```typescript
const root = createRoot(elem);
root.render(jupyterIcon.react);
```

If do you use `ReactDOM` to render, and if the `elem` node is ever
removed from the DOM, you’ll first need to clean it up:

```typescript
root.unmount();
```

This cleanup step is not a special property of `LabIcon`, but is instead
needed for any React component that is rendered directly at the top
level by `ReactDOM`.

## How to create your own custom `LabIcon`

You can create your own custom icon by constructing a new instance of
`LabIcon`:

```typescript
export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
  name: 'barpkg:foo',
  svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'
});
```

where `name` should be of the form “your-pkg:icon-name”, and `svgstr` is
the raw contents of your icon’s svg file.

## How to create a new `LabIcon` from an external svg file

Although you can copy-and-paste an svg directly into the `LabIcon`
constructor, the best practice is to keep the svg for each of your icons
in its own separate svg file. You will need to have an `svg.d.ts` file
at the root of your project’s `src` directory:

```typescript
// svg.d.ts

declare module '*.svg' {
  const value: string;
  export default value;
}
```

You can then `import` the contents of an svg file:

```typescript
import fooSvgstr from 'path-to-your/foo.svg';

export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
  name: 'barpkg:foo',
  svgstr: fooSvgstr
});
```

## Sync icon color to JupyterLab theme

<em>Example svgs with class annotation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/style/icons">ui-components/style/icons</a></em>

You can ensure that the colors of your custom `LabIcon` sync up to the
colors of the current JupyterLab theme by adding appropriate `class`
annotations to each colored element of your icon's svg.

In other words, each element of your svg that a `fill="..."` or a
`stroke="..."` property should also have a `class="jp-icon<whatever>"`
property.

### Available icon classes

<em>Icon-related CSS classes are defined in <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/style/icons.css">ui-components/style/icons.css</a></em>

All colors shown are for the standard light/dark theme, mouse over for
hex values.

#### `jp-iconX`: contrast to theme background

<ul>
<li>jp-icon0: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#111"/><title>#111</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon1: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#212121"/><title>#212121</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#fff"/><title>#fff</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon2: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#424242"/><title>#424242</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#eee"/><title>#eee</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon3: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#616161"/><title>#616161</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#bdbdbd"/><title>#bdbdbd</title></svg></li>
<li>jp-icon4: <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg> / <svg width="16" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect width="1" height="1" fill="#757575"/><title>#757575</title></svg></li>
</ul>

Most one-color icons in JupyterLab (including the sidebar and toolbar
icons) are colored using the `jp-icon3` class.

For light/dark themes, `jp-icon0` corresponds to the darkest/lightest
background color, while `jp-icon1` is somewhat lighter/darker, and so
forth.

#### `jp-icon-accentX`: match to theme background

For light/dark themes, `jp-icon-accent0` corresponds to the
lightest/darkest background color, while `jp-icon-accent1` is somewhat
darker/lighter, and so forth.

### Adding classes to a one-color icon

For most simple, one-color icons, it is desirable for the icon's color
to strongly contrast with that of the application's background. You can
achieve this using one of the `jp-iconX` classes.

**Example: check icon**

_svg source:_

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path
    class="jp-icon3"
    fill="#616161"
    d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"
  />
</svg>
```

_rendered icon:_

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" d="M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z"/>
</svg>

### Adding classes to a multi-colored icon

For more complex icons, each element that needs to match the background
should be annotated with a `jp-icon-accentX` class, while each element
that needs to contrast with the background should be annotated with a
`jp-iconX` class.

**Example: close-circle icon**

_svg source:_

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <circle class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" cx="12" cy="12" r="11" />
  <rect
    class="jp-icon-accent0"
    fill="#fff"
    height="18"
    width="2"
    x="11"
    y="3"
    transform="rotate(315, 12, 12)"
  />
  <rect
    class="jp-icon-accent0"
    fill="#fff"
    height="18"
    width="2"
    x="11"
    y="3"
    transform="rotate(45, 12, 12)"
  />
</svg>
```

_rendered icon:_

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <circle class="jp-icon3" fill="#616161" cx="12" cy="12" r="11"/>
  <rect class="jp-icon-accent0" fill="#fff" height="18" width="2" x="11" y="3" transform="rotate(315, 12, 12)"/>
  <rect class="jp-icon-accent0" fill="#fff" height="18" width="2" x="11" y="3" transform="rotate(45, 12, 12)"/>
</svg>

## Background

### Icon handling in Jupyterlab

Pre JupyterLab 2.0, most icons were created using the
icons-as-css-background pattern:

- Set up the icon’s svg as a `background-image` in CSS:

  ```css
  /* CSS */

  .jp-FooIcon {
    background-image: url('path-to-your/foo.svg');
  }
  ```

- Add the icon to the DOM by constructing an otherwise empty DOM node
  with the appropriate class:

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  const e = document.createElement('div');
  e.className = 'jp-FooIcon';
  document.body.append(e);
  ```

What you end up with is a single DOM node that has the “foo” icon as a
background image.

Post JupyterLab 2.0, nearly all icons in core are now created using
[LabIcon](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/src/icon/labicon.tsx)
and the icons-as-inline-svg pattern:

- Construct a new instance of LabIcon from the icon’s name and svg:

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  // svgstr is the raw contents of an icon's svg file
  export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({
    name: 'barpkg:foo',
    svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'
  });
  ```

- Add the icon to the DOM using the appropriate property of your
  LabIcon instance (either LabIcon.element() to directly create a DOM
  node, or LabIcon.react to get the icon as a react component):

  ```typescript
  // typescript

  const e = fooIcon.element();
  document.body.append(e);
  ```

What you end up with is a DOM node (by default a ‘div’) that has an
inline svg node as a child.

### `background-image` vs inline svg

The big limitation of the old icon-as-css-background pattern is that svg
images rendered as `background-image` are invisible to CSS. On the other
hand, an icon rendered as an inline svg node is fully exposed to the
CSS. This allows us to dynamically change icon styling as needed simply by
modifying our CSS. Most importantly, this allows us to recolor icons
according to Jupyterlab’s current theme.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @lumino/polling@2.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @lumino/polling

This package provides a class for generic polling functionality (`Poll`). It
also provides rate limiters (`Debouncer` and `Throttler`).

The `Poll` class provides three different ways to "subscribe" to poll ticks:

- [`@lumino/signaling`](../signaling/): `Poll#ticked` is a Lumino signal that
  emits each time there is a poll tick.
- `Promise`-based: `Poll#tick` is a promise that resolves after every tick and
  only rejects when the poll is disposed.
- `AsyncIterable`: `Poll#[`Symbol.asyncIterator`]` implements the async iterable
  protocol that allows iteration using [`for-await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loops.

## Example usage

These are examples from the unit tests for this package. They
demonstrate the three different ways polling is supported.

### Using `Poll#tick` promise

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
const expected = 'started resolved resolved';
const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];
const tock = (poll: Poll) => {
  ticker.push(poll.state.phase);
  poll.tick.then(tock).catch(() => undefined);
};
const poll = new Poll({
  auto: false,
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(),
  frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }
});
```

Next we assign the `tock` function to run after the poll ticks and
we start the poll.

```typescript
void poll.tick.then(tock);
void poll.start();
```

And we verify that the `ticker` did indeed get populated when `tock`
was called and the next promise was captured as well.

```typescript
await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.
expect(ticker.join(' ').startsWith(expected)).to.equal(true);
poll.dispose();
```

### Using `Poll#ticked` signal

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
const poll = new Poll<void, void>({
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(),
  frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }
});
```

Here we connect to the `ticked` signal and simply check that each
tick matches the poll `state` accessor's contents.

```typescript
poll.ticked.connect((_, tick) => {
  expect(tick).to.equal(poll.state);
});
await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.
poll.dispose();
```

### Using `Poll` as an `AsyncIterable`

Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.

```typescript
let poll: Poll;
let total = 2;
let i = 0;

poll = new Poll({
  auto: false,
  factory: () => Promise.resolve(++i > total ? poll.dispose() : void 0),
  frequency: { interval: Poll.IMMEDIATE }
});

const expected = `started${' resolved'.repeat(total)}`;
const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];
```

Then the poll is started:

```typescript
void poll.start();
```

Instead of connecting to the `ticked` signal or awaiting the `tick` promise, we can now use a `for-await...of` loop:

```typescript
for await (const state of poll) {
  ticker.push(state.phase);
  if (poll.isDisposed) {
    break;
  }
}
```

And we check to make sure the results are as expected:

```typescript
// ticker and expected both equal:
// 'started resolved resolved disposed'
expect(ticker.join(' ')).to.equal(expected);
```

### Note for consumers of async iterators

In order to use `for-await...of` loops in TypeScript, you will need to use `ES2018` or above in your `lib` array in `tsconfig.json`.

## Contributing

This monorepo uses `yarn`, so to start you'll need the package manager installed.

To run E2E tests you'll also need Playwright set up, which can be done locally via `npx playwright install`. Afterward, run `yarn start:app` and in a separate tab run `yarn e2e:ui` to boot up the test runner.

When you're done with your changes, we use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage release notes. Run `yarn changeset` to autogenerate notes to be appended to your pull request.

Thank you!

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - json-schema-merge-allof@0.8.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# json-schema-merge-allof [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mokkabonna/json-schema-merge-allof?branch=master)

> Merge schemas combined using allOf into a more readable composed schema free from allOf.

```bash
npm install json-schema-merge-allof --save
```

## Features

- **Real** and **safe** merging of schemas combined with **allOf**
- Takes away all allOf found in the whole schema
- Lossless in terms of validation rules, merged schema does not validate more or less than the original schema
- Results in a more readable root schema
- Removes almost all logical impossibilities
- Throws if no logical intersection is found (your schema would not validate anything from the start)
- Validates in a way not possible by regular simple meta validators
- Correctly considers additionalProperties, patternProperties and properties as a part of an whole when merging schemas containing those
- Correctly considers items and additionalItems as a whole when merging schemas containing those
- Supports merging schemas with items as array and direct schema
- Supports merging dependencies when mixed array and schema
- Supports all JSON schema core/validation keywords (v6, use custom resolvers to support other keywords)
- Option to override common impossibility like adding properties when using **additionalProperties: false**
- Pluggable keyword resolvers

## How

Since allOf require ALL schemas provided (including the parent schema) to apply, we can iterate over all the schemas, extracting all the values for say, **type**, and find the **intersection** of valid values. Here is an example:

```js
{
  type: ['object', 'null'],
  additionalProperties: {
    type: 'string',
    minLength: 5
  },
  allOf: [{
    type: ['array', 'object'],
    additionalProperties: {
      type: 'string',
      minLength: 10,
      maxLength: 20
    }
  }]
}
```

This result in the schema :
```js
{
  type: 'object',
  additionalProperties: {
    type: 'string',
    minLength: 10,
    maxLength: 20
  }
}
```

Notice that type now excludes null and array since those are not logically possible. Also minLength is raised to 10. The other properties have no conflict and are merged into the root schema with no resolving needed.

For other keywords other methods are used, here are some simple examples:

- minLength, minimum, minItems etc chooses the **highest** value of the conflicting values.
- maxLength, maximum, maxItems etc chooses the **lowest** value of the conflicting values.
- uniqueItems is true if **any** of the conflicting values are true

As you can see above the strategy is to choose the **most** restrictive of the set of values that conflict. For some keywords that is done by intersection, for others like **required** it is done by a union of all the values, since that is the most restrictive.

What you are left with is a schema completely free of allOf. Except for in a couple of values that are impossible to properly intersect/combine:

### not

When multiple conflicting **not** values are found, we also use the approach that pattern use, but instead of allOf we use anyOf. When extraction of common rules from anyOf is in place this can be further simplified.

## Options
**ignoreAdditionalProperties** default **false**

Allows you to combine schema properties even though some schemas have `additionalProperties: false` This is the most common issue people face when trying to expand schemas using allOf and a limitation of the json schema spec. Be aware though that the schema produced will allow more than the original schema. But this is useful if just want to combine schemas using allOf as if additionalProperties wasn't false during the merge process. The resulting schema will still get additionalProperties set to false.

**deep** boolean, default *true*
If false, resolves only the top-level `allOf` keyword in the schema.

If true, resolves all `allOf` keywords in the schema.


**resolvers** Object
Override any default resolver like this:

```js
mergeAllOf(schema, {
  resolvers: {
    title: function(values, path, mergeSchemas, options) {
      // choose what title you want to be used based on the conflicting values
      // resolvers MUST return a value other than undefined
    }
  }
})
```

The function is passed:

- **values** an array of the conflicting values that need to be resolved
- **path** an array of strings containing the path to the position in the schema that caused the resolver to be called (useful if you use the same resolver for multiple keywords, or want to implement specific logic for custom paths)
- **mergeSchemas** a function you can call that merges an array of schemas
- **options** the options mergeAllOf was called with


### Combined resolvers
Some keyword are dependant on other keywords, like properties, patternProperties, additionalProperties. To create a resolver for these the resolver requires this structure:

```js
mergeAllOf(schema, {
  resolvers: {
    properties:
      keywords: ['properties', 'patternProperties', 'additionalProperties'],
      resolver(values, parents, mergers, options) {

      }
    }
  }
})
```

This type of resolvers are expected to return an object containing the resolved values of all the associated keywords. The keys must be the name of the keywords. So the properties resolver need to return an object like this containing the resolved values for each keyword:

```js
{
    properties: ...,
    patternProperties: ...,
    additionalProperties: ...,
}
```

Also the resolve function is not passed **mergeSchemas**, but an object **mergers** that contains mergers for each of the related keywords. So properties get passed an object like this:

```js
const mergers = {
    properties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},
    patternProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},
    additionalProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas){...},
}
```

Some of the mergers requires you to supply a string of the name or index of the subschema you are currently merging. This is to make sure the path passed to child resolvers are correct.

### Default resolver
You can set a default resolver that catches any unknown keyword. Let's say you want to use the same strategy as the ones for the meta keywords, to use the first value found. You can accomplish that like this:

```js
mergeJsonSchema({
  ...
}, {
  resolvers: {
    defaultResolver: mergeJsonSchema.options.resolvers.title
  }
})
```


## Resolvers

Resolvers are called whenever multiple conflicting values are found on the same position in the schemas.

You can override a resolver by supplying it in the options.

### Lossy vs lossless

All built in reducers for validation keywords are lossless, meaning that they don't remove or add anything in terms of validation.

For meta keywords like title, description, $id, $schema, default the strategy is to use the first possible value if there are conflicting ones. So the root schema is prioritized. This process possibly removes some meta information from your schema. So it's lossy. Override this by providing custom resolvers.


## $ref

If one of your schemas contain a $ref property you should resolve them using a ref resolver like [json-schema-ref-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/json-schema-ref-parser) to dereference your schema for you first. Resolving $refs is not the task of this library.


## Other libraries

There exists some libraries that claim to merge schemas combined with allOf, but they just merge schemas using a **very** basic logic. Basically just the same as lodash merge. So you risk ending up with a schema that allows more or less than the original schema would allow.


## Restrictions

We cannot merge schemas that are a logical impossibility, like:

```js
{
  type: 'object',
  allOf: [{
    type: 'array'
  }]
}
```

The library will then throw an error reporting the values that had no valid intersection. But then again, your original schema wouldn't validate anything either.


## Roadmap

- [x] Treat the interdependent validations like properties and additionalProperties as one resolver (and items additionalItems)
- [ ] Extract repeating validators from anyOf/oneOf and merge them with parent schema
- [ ] After extraction of validators from anyOf/oneOf, compare them and remove duplicates.
- [ ] If left with only one in anyOf/oneOf then merge it to the parent schema.
- [ ] Expose seperate tools for validation, extraction
- [ ] Consider adding even more logical validation (like minLength <= maxLength)

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - react-arborist@3.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

![Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3460638/161630636-3512fe81-41c2-4ee5-8f7e-adaad07033b6.svg)

<h1>React Arborist</h1>

[See the Demos](https://react-arborist.netlify.app/)

The tree view is ubiquitous in software applications. This library provides the React ecosystem with a complete solution to build the equivalent of a VSCode sidebar, Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, or Sketch/Figma layers panel.

Here is a Gmail sidebar clone built with react-arborist.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3460638/197306119-59fe59e6-50ae-4bc2-8cb9-3faa2bc52cd2.gif" width="270px" alt="Gmail sidebar clone built with react-arborist" />

## Features

- Drag and drop sorting
- Open/close folders
- Inline renaming
- Virtualized rendering
- Custom styling
- Keyboard navigation
- Aria attributes
- Tree filtering
- Selection synchronization
- Callbacks (onScroll, onActivate, onSelect)
- Controlled or uncontrolled trees

## Installation

```
yarn add react-arborist
```

```
npm install react-arborist
```

## Examples

Assume our data is this:

```js
const data = [
  { id: "1", name: "Unread" },
  { id: "2", name: "Threads" },
  {
    id: "3",
    name: "Chat Rooms",
    children: [
      { id: "c1", name: "General" },
      { id: "c2", name: "Random" },
      { id: "c3", name: "Open Source Projects" },
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    name: "Direct Messages",
    children: [
      { id: "d1", name: "Alice" },
      { id: "d2", name: "Bob" },
      { id: "d3", name: "Charlie" },
    ],
  },
];
```

### The Simplest Tree

Use all the defaults. The _initialData_ prop makes the tree an uncontrolled component. Create, move, rename, and delete will be handled internally.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Tree initialData={data} />;
}
```

<img width="214" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3460638/198098015-d7dc6400-6391-4094-9f66-0f56a99433e9.png">

[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/the-simplest-tree-7tbedw)

### Customize the Appearance

We provide our own dimensions and our own `Node` component.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Tree
      initialData={data}
      openByDefault={false}
      width={600}
      height={1000}
      indent={24}
      rowHeight={36}
      overscanCount={1}
      paddingTop={30}
      paddingBottom={10}
      padding={25 /* sets both */}
    >
      {Node}
    </Tree>
  );
}

function Node({ node, style, dragHandle }) {
  /* This node instance can do many things. See the API reference. */
  return (
    <div style={style} ref={dragHandle}>
      {node.isLeaf ? "🍁" : "🗀"}
      {node.data.name}
    </div>
  );
}
```

<img width="166" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3460638/198100281-594a492d-2ea0-4ff0-883d-1dd79dbb5acd.png">

[Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/customize-appearance-f4g15v?file=/src/App.tsx)

### Control the Tree data

Here we use the _data_ prop to make the tree a controlled component. We must handle all the data modifications ourselves using the props below.

```jsx
function App() {
  /* Handle the data modifications outside the tree component */
  const onCreate = ({ parentId, index, type }) => {};
  const onRename = ({ id, name }) => {};
  const onMove = ({ dragIds, parentId, index }) => {};
  const onDelete = ({ ids }) => {};

  return (
    <Tree
      data={data}
      onCreate={onCreate}
      onRename={onRename}
      onMove={onMove}
      onDelete={onDelete}
    />
  );
}
```

### Tree Filtering

Providing a non-empty _searchTerm_ will only show nodes that match. If a child matches, all its parents also match. Internal nodes are opened when filtering. You can provide your own _searchMatch_ function, or use the default.

```jsx
function App() {
  const term = useSearchTermString()
  <Tree
    data={data}
    searchTerm={term}
    searchMatch={
      (node, term) => node.data.name.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())
    }
  />
}
```

### Sync the Selection

It's common to open something elsewhere in the app, but have the tree reflect the new selection.

Passing an id to the _selection_ prop will select and scroll to that node whenever that id changes.

```jsx
function App() {
  const chatId = useCurrentChatId();

  /* 
    Whenever the currentChatRoomId changes, 
    the tree will automatically select it and scroll to it. 
  */

  return <Tree initialData={data} selection={chatId} />;
}
```

### Use the Tree Api Instance

You can access the Tree Api in the parent component by giving a ref to the tree.

```jsx
function App() {
  const treeRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    const tree = treeRef.current;
    tree.selectAll();
    /* See the Tree API reference for all you can do with it. */
  }, []);

  return <Tree initialData={data} ref={treeRef} />;
}
```

### Data with Different Property Names

The _idAccessor_ and _childrenAccessor_ props allow you to specify the children and id fields in your data.

```jsx
function App() {
  const data = [
    {
      category: "Food",
      subCategories: [{ category: "Restaurants" }, { category: "Groceries" }],
    },
  ];
  return (
    <Tree
      data={data}
      /* An accessor can provide a string property name */
      idAccessor="category"
      /* or a function with the data as the argument */
      childrenAccessor={(d) => d.subCategories}
    />
  );
}
```

### Custom Rendering

Render every single piece of the tree yourself. See the API reference for the props passed to each renderer.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <Tree
      data={data}
      /* The outer most element in the list */
      renderRow={MyRow}
      /* The "ghost" element that follows the mouse as you drag */
      renderDragPreview={MyDragPreview}
      /* The line that shows where an element will be dropped */
      renderCursor={MyCursor}
    >
      {/* The inner element that shows the indentation and data */}
      {MyNode}
    </Tree>
  );
}
```

## Row Component Props

The _\<RowRenderer\>_ is responsible for attaching the drop ref, the row style (top, height) and the aria-attributes. The default should work fine for most use cases, but it can be replaced by your own component if you need. See the _renderRow_ prop in the _\<Tree\>_ component.

```ts
type RowRendererProps<T> = {
  node: NodeApi<T>;
  innerRef: (el: HTMLDivElement | null) => void;
  attrs: HTMLAttributes<any>;
  children: ReactElement;
};
```

## Node Component Props

The _\<NodeRenderer\>_ is responsible for attaching the drag ref, the node style (padding for indentation), the visual look of the node, the edit input of the node, and anything else you can dream up.

There is a default renderer, but it's only there as a placeholder to get started. You'll want to create your own component for this. It is passed as the _\<Tree\>_ components only child.

```ts
export type NodeRendererProps<T> = {
  style: CSSProperties;
  node: NodeApi<T>;
  tree: TreeApi<T>;
  dragHandle?: (el: HTMLDivElement | null) => void;
  preview?: boolean;
};
```

## DragPreview Component Props

The _\<DragPreview\>_ is responsible for showing a "ghost" version of the node being dragged. The default is a semi-transparent version of the NodeRenderer and should work fine for most people. To customize it, pass your new component to the _renderDragPreview_ prop.

```ts
type DragPreviewProps = {
  offset: XYCoord | null;
  mouse: XYCoord | null;
  id: string | null;
  dragIds: string[];
  isDragging: boolean;
};
```

## Cursor Component Props

The _\<Cursor\>_ is responsible for showing a line that indicates where the node will move to when it's dropped. The default is a blue line with circle on the left side. You may want to customize this. Pass your own component to the _renderCursor_ prop.

```ts
export type CursorProps = {
  top: number;
  left: number;
  indent: number;
};
```

## Node API Reference

### State Properties

All these properties on the node instance return booleans related to the state of the node.

_node_.**isRoot**

Returns true if this is the root node. The root node is added internally by react-arborist and not shown in the UI.

_node_.**isLeaf**

Returns true if the children property is not an array.

_node_.**isInternal**

Returns true if the children property is an array.

_node_.**isOpen**

Returns true if node is internal and in an open state.

_node_.**isEditing**

Returns true if this node is currently being edited. Use this property in the NodeRenderer to render the rename form.

_node_.**isSelected**

Returns true if node is selected.

_node_.**isSelectedStart**

Returns true if node is the first of a contiguous group of selected nodes. Useful for styling.

_node_.**isSelectedEnd**

Returns true if node is the last of a contiguous group of selected nodes. Useful for styling.

_node_.**isOnlySelection**

Returns true if node is the only node selected in the tree.

_node_.**isFocused**

Returns true if node is focused.

_node_.**isDragging**

Returns true if node is being dragged.

_node_.**willReceiveDrop**

Returns true if node is internal and the user is hovering a dragged node over it.

_node_.**state**

Returns an object with all the above properties as keys and boolean values. Useful for adding class names to an element with a library like [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) or [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames).

```ts
type NodeState = {
  isEditing: boolean;
  isDragging: boolean;
  isSelected: boolean;
  isSelectedStart: boolean;
  isSelectedEnd: boolean;
  isFocused: boolean;
  isOpen: boolean;
  isClosed: boolean;
  isLeaf: boolean;
  isInternal: boolean;
  willReceiveDrop: boolean;
};
```

### Accessors

_node_.**childIndex**

Returns the node's index in relation to its siblings.

_node_.**next**

Returns the next visible node. The node directly under this node in the tree component. Returns null if none exist.

_node_.**prev**

Returns the previous visible node. The node directly above this node in the tree component. Returns null if none exist.

_node_.**nextSibling**

Returns the next sibling in the data of this node. Returns null if none exist.

### Selection Methods

_node_.**select**()

Select only this node.

_node_.**deselect**()

Deselect this node. Other nodes may still be selected.

_node_.**selectMulti**()

Select this node while maintaining all other selections.

_node_.**selectContiguous**()

Deselect all nodes from the anchor node to the last selected node, the select all nodes from the anchor node to this node. The anchor changes to the focused node after calling _select()_ or _selectMulti()_.

### Activation Methods

_node_.**activate**()

Runs the Tree props' onActivate callback passing in this node.

_node_.**focus**()

Focus this node.

### Open/Close Methods

_node_.**open**()

Opens the node if it is an internal node.

_node_.**close**()

Closes the node if it is an internal node.

_node_.**toggle**()

Toggles the open/closed state of the node if it is an internal node.

_node_.**openParents**()

Opens all the parents of this node.

_node_.**edit**()

Moves this node into the editing state. Calling node._isEditing_ will return true.

_node_.**submit**(_newName_)

Submits _newName_ string to the _onRename_ handler. Moves this node out of the editing state.

_node_.**reset**()

Moves this node out of the editing state without submitting a new name.

### Event Handlers

_node_.**handleClick**(_event_)

Useful for using the standard selection methods when a node is clicked. If the meta key is down, call _multiSelect()_. If the shift key is down, call _selectContiguous()_. Otherwise, call _select()_ and _activate()_.

## Tree API Reference

The tree api reference is stable across re-renders. It always has the most recent state and props.

### Node Accessors

_tree_.**get**(_id_) : _NodeApi | null_

[![npm dependents](https://badgen.net/npm/dependents/type-fest)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-fest?activeTab=dependents)
[![npm downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dt/type-fest)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-fest)
[![Docs](https://paka.dev/badges/v0/cute.svg)](https://paka.dev/npm/type-fest)

Many of the types here should have been built-in. You can help by suggesting some of them to the [TypeScript project](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Either add this package as a dependency or copy-paste the needed types. No credit required. 👌

PR welcome for additional commonly needed types and docs improvements. Read the [contributing guidelines](.github/contributing.md) first.

**Help wanted with reviewing [proposals](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pulls).**

## Install

```sh
npm install type-fest
```

*Requires TypeScript >=4.2*

## Usage

```ts
import type {Except} from 'type-fest';

type Foo = {
	unicorn: string;
	rainbow: boolean;
};

type FooWithoutRainbow = Except<Foo, 'rainbow'>;
//=> {unicorn: string}
```

## API

Click the type names for complete docs.

### Basic

- [`Primitive`](source/primitive.d.ts) - Matches any [primitive value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive).

- [`PartialDeep`](source/partial-deep.d.ts) - Create a deeply optional version of another type. Use [`Partial<T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype) if you only need one level deep.
- [`PartialOnUndefinedDeep`](source/partial-on-undefined-deep.d.ts) - Create a deep version of another type where all keys accepting `undefined` type are set to optional.
- [`ReadonlyDeep`](source/readonly-deep.d.ts) - Create a deeply immutable version of an `object`/`Map`/`Set`/`Array` type. Use [`Readonly<T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#readonlytype) if you only need one level deep.
- [`LiteralUnion`](source/literal-union.d.ts) - Create a union type by combining primitive types and literal types without sacrificing auto-completion in IDEs for the literal type part of the union. Workaround for [Microsoft/TypeScript#29729](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729).

## Declined types

*If we decline a type addition, we will make sure to document the better solution here.*

- [`Diff` and `Spread`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/7) - The pull request author didn't provide any real-world use-cases and the PR went stale. If you think this type is useful, provide some real-world use-cases and we might reconsider.
- [`Dictionary`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/33) - You only save a few characters (`Dictionary<number>` vs `Record<string, number>`) from [`Record`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type), which is more flexible and well-known. Also, you shouldn't use an object as a dictionary. We have `Map` in JavaScript now.
- [`ExtractProperties` and `ExtractMethods`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/4) - The types violate the single responsibility principle. Instead, refine your types into more granular type hierarchies.
- [`Url2Json`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/262) - Inferring search parameters from a URL string is a cute idea, but not very useful in practice, since search parameters are usually dynamic and defined separately.
- [`Nullish`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/318) - The type only saves a couple of characters, not everyone knows what "nullish" means, and I'm also trying to [get away from `null`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meta/discussions/7).
- [`TitleCase`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/303) - It's not solving a common need and is a better fit for a separate package.
- [`ExtendOr` and `ExtendAnd`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/pull/247) - The benefits don't outweigh having to learn what they mean.
- [`PackageJsonExtras`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/issues/371) - There are too many possible configurations that can be put into `package.json`. If you would like to extend `PackageJson` to support an additional configuration in your project, please see the *Extending existing types* section below.

## Alternative type names

*If you know one of our types by a different name, add it here for discovery.*

- `PartialBy` - See [`SetOptional`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/set-optional.d.ts)
- `RecordDeep`- See [`Schema`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/schema.d.ts)

## Tips

### Extending existing types

- [`PackageJson`](source/package-json.d.ts) - There are a lot of tools that place extra configurations inside the `package.json` file. You can extend `PackageJson` to support these additional configurations.
